Contribution:

    This was an individual project.

    Set up animations for a 2D Kirby Sprite and a 2D Santa Sprite. First experience with slicing sprite sheets, animating 2D sprites, etc.

    Set up scripts for sounds when Kirby walks; for music when Kirby approaches the present.

    Set up scripts for the text display and the text crawl.

    Set up scripts for the proximity trigger near the present. 


See DemoFootage folder for short clips of what I was able to accomplish.

My favorites are: 
  
    Demo_Proposal_ProximityTrigger_Audio.mp4, 
    Demo_Kirby_Showcase.mp4, 
    and Demo_Chase.mp4.
