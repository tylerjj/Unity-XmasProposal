Set up animations for a 2D Kirby Sprite and a 2D Santa Sprite. First experience with slicing sprite sheets, animating 2D sprites, etc.
Set up scripts for sounds when Kirby walks; for music when Kirby approaches the present.
Set up scripts for the text display and the text crawl.
Set up scripts for the proximity trigger near the present. 

Eventually used this project to propose to my wife. Was a fun month-long exercise in learning some of Unity's 2D engine. 
First experience with slicing sprite sheets, animating 2D sprites, and setting up a 2D platformer in Unity.)
